### Overview
A system information system dedicated to St Columba's High School in Zimbabwe as a solution to their paper based system.This was the second developed version of the final product. The application uses Swing panel with Gradient for the UI.Currently it is not functioning as expected as I could not find a place to host the MySQL database.However, one can just browse through and look at the code. And it will probably be ready to run soon. With improvements
