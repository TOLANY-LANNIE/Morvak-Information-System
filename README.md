# Morvak-Information-System

A system information system dedicated to St Columba's High School in Zimbabwe as a solution to their paper based system.This was the second developed version of the final product. Currently it is not functioning as expected as I could not find a place to host the MySQL database.
However, one can just browse through and look at the code. And it will probably be ready to run soon. With imporvements
The application allows the following functions:
* Adding new student and teachers into the system
* Teachers can add student marks
* Student are able to see their marks for different modules

Below are some of the screenshots of the application:
